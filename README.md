# BrowsifyForGit version 0.1

A simple and kinda useless tool to visualize **all your git needs***! 
*disclaimer: we asume all your needs are searching for repos and getting their comments*
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## i wanna see it! 

Fret not! for the only thing you need to do is to run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## i wanna see a production ready version!

i guess you could build the project, but due to time constrains it is not optimized for prod deployment.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## About those unit tests

You can run them, some (a lot) will not pass, because im a noob in testing, but i learned a lot about them, i know you're not supposed to retroactively make them work, but that is one of my next objectives for future updates, just because i want to learn more about testing. 

oh yeah, if you wanna see them fail you can run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## further update plans:

i really liked this exercise so i will try to update it to add a lot more functionality to it, some things i have planned include: 
* sorting methods and filters for searches.
* more utility to search function, search by topic, lenguage, etc, there's a lot of interesting stuff in the api
* a better way to represent each repo.
* revise the ui design, it was kinda rushed.
* fix some visual bugs
* and whatever else comes to mind later.
